# LinkedListPuzzle contains two tasks on LinkedList collection:
- FindInfiniteLoop: You are asked that if you have a linked list in which you can traverse only in one direction, 
and if that linked list has a loop in it, how you will detect it
- LinkedListReverse : Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list.
We need to reverse the list by changing links between nodes.
